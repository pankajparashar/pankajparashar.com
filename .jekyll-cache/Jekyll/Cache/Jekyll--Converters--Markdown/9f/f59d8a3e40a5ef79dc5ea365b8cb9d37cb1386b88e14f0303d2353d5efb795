I"<p>Over the weekend, I dished out a realtime in-browser code editor, perfect for
collaborating online with other developers. It can also be used as a whiteboard
to interview candidates distanced by geographical location. As far as the technology
stack is concerned,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> is the backend.</li>
  <li><a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.io</a> is used to establish real-time communication across users.</li>
  <li>HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript constitutes the front-end.</li>
</ul>
