I"ï<p>This <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">bug</a> was discovered on April 07, 2014, by Neel Mehta from Google Security and the team of security engineers (Riku, Antti and Matti) from Codenomicon and has affacted v1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases of OpenSSL including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1.</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/1354/">XKCD does a better job</a> of explaining a lay manâ€™s version of the bug. For a more technical description, I would recommend reading <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed">Cloudfareâ€™s</a> version of explanation. They even had a <a href="https://www.cloudflarechallenge.com/heartbleed">challenge page</a> setup to lure hackers to expose the vulnerabilities of the web server by hacking in to the private key of the SSL certificate.</p>

<p>Within 3 hours, <a href="https://twitter.com/indutny">Fedor Indutny</a>, a core team member of Node.js <a href="https://twitter.com/indutny/statuses/454761620259225600">cracked</a> the encryption and made the <a href="https://gist.github.com/indutny/a11c2568533abcf8b9a1">RSA key public</a>. Someone also added a bounty on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7573679">Hacker News</a> for whoever published and confirmed successful completion of this challenge.</p>

<h4 id="the-bug">The Bug</h4>

<p>The Heartbleed bug, revealed on Monday, was the product of a fluke introduced by a young German researcher. He admitted that he had unintentionally introduced the bug on New Yearâ€™s Eve 2011 while working on bug fixes for OpenSSL.</p>

<p>The bug was missing a bound check in the handling of the TLS heartbeat extension that can be used to reveal up to 64k of memory to a connected client or server. The precise flaw in the source code is illustrated <a href="https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/96db9023b881d7cd9f379b0c154650d6c108e9a3#diff-2">here</a> on Github, touted as a billion dollar mistake due to poor coding implementation which resulted into this bug.</p>
