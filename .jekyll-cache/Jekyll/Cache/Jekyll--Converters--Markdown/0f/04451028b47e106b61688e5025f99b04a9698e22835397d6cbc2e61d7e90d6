I"H<p>Recently, I’ve started using <a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">GTmetrix</a> to analyze and
improve the performance of my personal website. It allows you to audit your
website against industry benchmarks like <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/?hl=en">PageSpeed</a>,
<a href="http://yslow.org/">YSlow</a> etc. and also provides a video and a filmstrip to
demonstrate the perceived rendering of your website.</p>

<p>I’m very happy about the results with benchmarks running close to 100%, page
loading under half-a-second and significantly smaller payload.</p>
