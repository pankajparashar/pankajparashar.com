I"½<p>Github provides two types of pages,</p>
<ul>
  <li>User pages</li>
  <li>Project pages</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="user-pages">User pages</h4>

<p>It is nothing but a Github repository with a special name <code class="highlighter-rouge">username.github.io</code> and all the contents of this repository must be in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch. For example, <a href="https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io">pankajparashar.github.io</a> is a repository for user pages under my Github username, <a href="https://github.com/pankajparashar">pankajparashar</a>.</p>

<p>By default, the user pages are available under the url, <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://username.github.io</code>.</p>

<h4 id="project-pages">Project pages</h4>

<p>Project pages are project specific files lying in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">gh-pages</code> branch of the repository. These pages can be accessed via the url <code class="highlighter-rouge">username.github.io/repository_name</code>.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">Repository name -&gt; Color Stack  
URL -&gt; http://pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack</code></pre></figure>

<h4 id="custom-domain">Custom domain</h4>

<p>Now, coming to the meat of the article, custom domain can be set for both user and project pages. Moreover, the steps to setup the domain also remains the same for both the categories. However, this article will only deal with setting up custom domain for the user pages only.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br />
Create the repository <code class="highlighter-rouge">username.github.io</code> on Github. For reference, check my <a href="https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io">user repository on Github</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br />
Add a CNAME file containing the custom domain name that you want to map. In my case, the <a href="https://github.com/pankajparashar/pankajparashar.github.io/blob/master/CNAME">CNAME</a> file contains, <code class="highlighter-rouge">pankajparashar.com</code></p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong><br />
Login to your domain name registrar and create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> record that maps the domain to the Githubâ€™s IP address - <code class="highlighter-rouge">204.232.175.78</code>. (Infact, this IP Address no longer works and has been <a href="https://github.com/blog/1925-github-pages-legacy-ip-brownout">deprecated by Github</a>. The new IP Addresses are, <code class="highlighter-rouge">192.30.252.153</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">192.30.252.154</code> as mentioned in <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tips-for-configuring-an-a-record-with-your-dns-provider/">this article</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is no guarantee that this IP address will remain the same forever. Indeed, Github has changed its value in the past. Presumably Github will notify users appropriately before any future changes. If they do change it, youâ€™ll have to adjust the configuration at your DNS registrar accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Theoretically it can take 30 mins to 2 hours for the DNS propagation to complete, but in my experience this change took 1 full day to reflect. Once the propagation is complete, whenever you visit <code class="highlighter-rouge">pankajparashar.github.io</code> you will be redirected to my custom domain <code class="highlighter-rouge">pankajparashar.com</code>.</p>

<p>The interesting part is that all the project pages are also being redirected under the same <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">Top-Level domain</a>. This is fantastic, because for years I have been trying to bring all my projects and the personal website under the same domain. This process makes my entire workflow completely seamless.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My Color Stack project, available at the url <a href="http://pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack">pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack</a> is now automatically being redirected to <a href="http://pankajparashar.github.io/color-stack">pankajparashar.com/color-stack</a>.</p>

<p>By the way, this tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/jackrugile">@jackrugile</a> triggered me to write this piece,</p>
