I"A<p>The awesome folks at <a href="https://www.webucator.com/">Webucator</a> converted my article on <a href="http://pankajparashar.com/posts/python-regular-expressions/">Regular Expressions in Python</a>
into a training video which can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K28U0HvkIG8">here on Youtube</a>. I particularly liked the 
concept of transforming an article into a full length training video and I must say that Webucator has done an incredible job.</p>

<p>Webucator also offers customized Python training for public online classes and self-paced Python courses for individual 
students on its <a href="https://www.webucator.com/programming/python.cfm">website</a>. I couldnâ€™t be more happier to recommend them not
just for learning Python but a bunch of other languages as well that they have to offer.</p>
