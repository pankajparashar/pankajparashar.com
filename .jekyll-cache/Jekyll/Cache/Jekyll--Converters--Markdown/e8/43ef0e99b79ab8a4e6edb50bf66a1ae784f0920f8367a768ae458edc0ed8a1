I"¯<p>Recently, I <a href="https://twitter.com/pankajparashar/status/554256377841844224">tweeted</a> about using 
<a href="http://codepen.io/">Codepen</a> to beautify your CSS code. I got few reactions in response asking me to explain the 
process. The idea is simple â€”</p>

<ol>
  <li>Copy-paste your compressed code in the CSS section.</li>
  <li>Select a pre-processor of your choice that allows you to write native CSS code.</li>
  <li>Switch to the compiled version and extract the output.</li>
</ol>

<p>Iâ€™ve also got a GIF version of the above steps,</p>

<p>!(//res.cloudinary.com/dw9fem4ki/image/upload/v1421489236/beautify-css_swilwg.gif)[]</p>

<p>Currently, this approach would work with LESS, Stylus and Scss. It obviously wouldnâ€™t work with the indented syntax
version of Sass, simply because it doesnâ€™t consider the CSS syntax as valid. Unfortunately, this approach doesnâ€™t work 
for other languages like HTML and JavaScript.</p>

  <p>Although, Markdown supports HTML tags, the compiled version does not beautify the HTML tags.</p>

<p>This hidden feature can take Codepen a notch higher and bring it very close to fully functional code editor.</p>
