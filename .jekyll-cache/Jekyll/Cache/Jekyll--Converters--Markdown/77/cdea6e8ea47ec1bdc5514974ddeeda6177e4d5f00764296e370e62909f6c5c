I"8<p><a href="http://lesscss.org/about/#team">Matthew Dean</a>, a core-team member of Less wrote
an interesting piece, comparing Less with Sass and highlighting important
differences between the design decisions of the two pre-processors. Obviously,
there is no clear winner here!</p>

<p>I’ve been using Sass, for as long as <a href="http://pankajparashar.com/posts/why-do-i-hate-css-preprocessors/">I can remember</a>
but the arguments made by Matt in his article are compelling enough for me to
atleast try Less. If you don’t believe me, go read his article.</p>
