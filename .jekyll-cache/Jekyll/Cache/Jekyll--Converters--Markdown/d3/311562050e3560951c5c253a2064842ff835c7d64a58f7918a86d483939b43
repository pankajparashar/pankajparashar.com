I"r<p>The <a href="http://uxlaunchpad.com/">UX Launchpad</a> team has done an in-depth analysis and a comprehensive
review of comparing the mapping experience on iOS and Android. The article uses a bunch of parameters
to evaluate the user experience on both the apps with no clear winner.</p>

<p>The idea behind this article is to teach rather than judge, with just a bunch of design lessons inspired from studying two
similar products. Do not complain if you find the article too long for your liking!</p>
