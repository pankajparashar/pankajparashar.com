title: Dark Mode
layout: post
excerpt: Its not surprising that dark mode is the new fad in the town after Apple introduced the
  dark mode in MacOS. I decided to add a toggle button to switch to the dark mode on my blog.
---

I intentionally stayed away from using the CSS `prefers-color-scheme` media query to automatically apply the mode the user's device is switched to. Instead we have a button in the header that will be used to toggle the dark mode. By default the site always loads in light/day mode.

## Step 1

Identify all the colors in your stylesheet and qualify them under a naming scheme using CSS variables defined in the `:root`. Replace all the instances of each color value with its variable name , like `var(--fore-color)`.

```
:root {
    --fore-color: #697076;
    --back-color: #fff;
    --primary-color: #21272a;
    --bq-color: #FCF7F4;
}
```

## Step 2

Now you can define a new CSS class `.dark` that will override the values of these variables based on how you want your site to look like in the dark mode.

```
.dark {
    --fore-color: #ccc;
    --back-color: #21272a;
    --primary-color: #fff;
    --bq-color: #37474f;
}
```

## Step 3

Its now time to add a toggle button that will toggle the class `.dark` everytime its clicked.

```
<a role="button" 
   onclick="document.body.classList.toggle('dark');return false"
   style="cursor:pointer">ðŸŒ“</a>
```

Its done! Now you have a dark mode running on your site.
