excerpt: Its been four years since I last wrote an article on this blog. Even though
  the domain has been active, the content has been lying dormant for a while. To take
  a positive spin out of this ongoing pandemic, I promised myself to revive this blog
  and resurrect the old content for everyone's pleasure.

Albeit, there'll be some articles that still needs formatting based on the new layout, but hold your breath, those changes are coming thick and fast.
